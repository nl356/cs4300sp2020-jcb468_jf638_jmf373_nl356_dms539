Ripping markers up over shots of the Henny Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude? To me, Benihana is pigeon food This not a forgiving mood So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room I am just a body that my brothers are living through Keeping my connections strictly physical Everyone that's married is miserable I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical I don't carry cash cause the money is digital It's the American Expresser, the debt collector Hailing all the way from the Mecca Got something for Trudy and Rebecca This shit could last forever The mind controller, the Ayatollah I built a bridge to success and had visions of me riding over Step in the room and October gets a lot closer Haunted houses I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions Now tell your friends I'm not the villain Send em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago Never go the same places they go Separate vacations A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement I was never on the path to get into Cambridge I mean, I was good at doing math, but I'm better with language Borderline dangerous, approach with caution I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction Man, truth be told, I think about it often The petty king, the overseer of many things I wish that I was playing in a sport where we were getting rings I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing Cosa Nostra, shady dealings Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling But no regrets, though, the name'll echo Years later, none greater Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah ",

I've been learning Grabbing my keepsakes, leaving my burdens Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect Looking at the view, like this concerns me Picking up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry And things might hurt me It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey It's worth it, though Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam Looking for the antidote to crack the code Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone Talking down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for cracking jokes I'm looking for the map to hope, you seen it? Been making a whole lot of changes Wrote a song about that, you should play it I get scared when I walk on these stages I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah That's when I start to get anxious That's when my thoughts can be dangerous That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred Forget what I'm saying, and\u2014 Where'd the beat go? Oh, ain't that somethin'? Drums came in, you ain't see that comin' Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin' Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach Throw it back up like I don't want it Wipe my face, clean off my vomit OCD, tryna push my buttons I said don't touch it, now y'all done it I can be critical, never typical Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal Intimate, but never political, pretty visual Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool Way that I been thinking is cinematic, it's beautiful Man, I don't know if I'm making movies or music videos Videos, videos Yeah, the sales can rise Doesn't mean much though when your health declines See, we've all got something that we trapped inside That we try to suffocate, you know, hoping it dies Try to hold it underwater but it always survives Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am The point I'm making is the mind is a powerful place And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay? Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great You'll never be great\u2014not because you're not, but the hate Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith Woo I've been developin', take a look at the benefits Nothing to meddle with, I can never be delicate Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah It's that time again Better grab your balloons and invite your friends Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap em in Look at me, everybody, I'm smiling big On a road right now that I can't predict Tell me Tone that down, but I can't resist Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist The search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huh ",

Overdosing at the crib 'Cause people just won't let em live And the public is constantly thinking they know em But nobody knowing what's going on inside And they wonder why we all hide, shit Maybe I'm just overthinkin' Or maybe I'm just over-smoking and drinkin' And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate Sit in the corner and think of a better day Maybe this bullet can help me to get away I just cannot seem to think of a better way Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin' That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin' Even when I'm hearing I'm a bitch, I'm a fag I'm a motherfucking hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself Kill myself 'Cause you'll never be Kenny\" \"You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole\" \"You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old, yeah These are the comments I'm reading on Twitter right now That make me depressed and they pulling me down I'm trying to swim but I think I'ma drown So I'ma turn that feeling into a sound And play it when nobody else is around Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground God, give me the power to battle depression Yeah, round after round I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich I wish I could just get up out of this bitch But be careful what you wish for 'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be My life is good but not as good as it's bout to be 'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am Do what you love and do not give a damn Fuck all the haters you see on the Gram Just mind your own business and be a good man Be a good boss and be a good friend Spread your imagination to the millions Don't worry bout how to maintain all your millions Just spread that positivity for the children And all the haters that's hatin', just love em 'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill em Know somebody feel em Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf And remember, love yourself Nah, nah, nah Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself Nah, nah, nah Put your ego on the shelf And remember, love your\u2014'member, love yourself Nah, nah, nah Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself Nah, nah, nah ",

You know you gotta let it out I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve On a no cab tractor hauling them bales Backing in boats, fishing limb lines Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines Step side cover down in peanut dust Friday night spotlight, and that was us It might not have been you, but I ain't judging And just be proud of what makes you country Whatever makes you country You do your kind of country They doing they kind of country I do my kind of country Whatever makes us country ",

Fuck it, I'm going for the jugular Shit is a circus, you clowns that are coming up Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck About the ones that were here before you that made rap Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at? We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back 'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that But I think it's inevitable They know what button to press or what lever to pull To get me to snap though Lil' bitch And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly making it bigger But you've been taking ya digs in the fucking back, ho Get it? On the brink, any minute got me thinking of finishin' Everything with acetaminophen and reaping the benefits I'm asleep at the wheel again As I peak into thinking about an evil intent Of another beat I'ma kill again 'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram And I might as well cause I'ma end up being a villain again Levels to this shit, I got an elevator You could never say to me I'm not a fucking record breaker I sound like a broken record every time I break a record Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way I got spite inside my DNA But I wrote til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy It's the moment y'all been waiting for Like California wishing rain to pour In that drought, y'all been praying for My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw Still the same Marshall, that outlaw That they say as a writer might've fell off I'm back on that bull like the cowboy So y'all gotta move Yeah, y'all gotta move Yeah, y'all gotta move Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice ",

Death before your eyes, you praying to God, but ain't no response Tryna scream for hope, just a shoulder that you can lean on But ain't nobody comin', so you scream on and scream on and scream on While this evil fuck laugh at you Train getting closer, you still surprised that he battered you Tears falling harder and harder, minutes get minuscule Could've had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do? You finna die here on this train track 'Cause clearly after death, ain't no way you can find your way back Thinking bout your previous memories, going way back All them fucking dreams bout a diamond chain and a Maybach Now your time finally up Ask yourself this final question, is you going down or up? Recollecting all the moments that you never gave a fuck Now it's here, death has now arrived, time's finally up ",

Mama told me, Fuck the world and be so aggressive Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes cause they so obsessive\" I don't get too high to look over blessings Never come in second, make the most of your seconds They so precious 'Cause if we could buy time every store would sell it If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic Where the weed?

That's the question I ask the reader God bless the reader Dear Life What is my meaning? My reason? That's the question You know, when he told me Toya was having a baby, I say, Y'all young You know y'all young. But I said, Be the best father you can be, you know And truly, he is that ",

I don't know who you are anymore Talking to the man in her mirror That been fucking with these bitches And it's dangerous, sleeping with these strangers Every night a different woman, doing the same shit But, you don't even call anymore And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone? I know it's fucked up Different city, switching women Putting cups up, getting fucked up And, we don't even talk anymore Ain't got no time to spare So who are we to trust anyone? And that's what's fucked up We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other And that's so fucked up Damn, love don't live here Love, I don't live here She say, Why you leave your shit here?\" I'm tryna be sincere When we both know it ain't right She hate that we can get loose But I can never hang tight But, we don't even make love anymore Acting like our phone got our attention Though we watching television, and it's painless We act like we strangers I just don't know who we are anymore, damn I'm not supposed to be here 'Cause love don't live here But I'm here, and she here She tell me stay all night She just want a refill And then she want to start fights 'Bout What about how she feel?\" She tell me I'm a cheap thrill I know she don't mean that She think I feed her lies But I don't get no feedback As she watch me pack \"Baby where my keys at?\" Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back Her teeth smacked I don't know who you are anymore Talking to the man in her mirror That been fucking with these bitches And it's dangerous, sleeping with these strangers Every night a different woman, doing the same shit But you don't even call anymore And you don't even care So who am I to love anyone?

I got a jet in the morn' And she upset and I'm calm And when a woman is scorned Is when your welcome is worn And now her temperature's showin' And I just weather her storm And she expect me to stay I be like, Let go my arm!\" She said... I don't know who you are anymore\u200b Talking to the man in her mirror I've been fucking with these bitches And it's dangerous, sleeping with these strangers Every night a different woman, doing the same shit And she say, you don't even call anymore And you don't even care So who am I to love anyone?
